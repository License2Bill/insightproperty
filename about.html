                    <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
                    <p>Insight Property Services was founded with a simple mission: to provide high-quality construction and renovation services while maintaining exceptional communication and customer service throughout every project.</p>
                    
                    <p>With over 20+ years of combined construction experience, our founders have worked in almost every construction trade, from building foundations to complete home renovations. We've seen the industry from every angle and understand what it takes to deliver exceptional results.</p>
                    
                    <p>What sets us apart is our commitment to clear communication. We've noticed that the biggest complaint from property owners is a lack of communication when working with contractors. That's why we go the extra mile to ensure you understand what we're doing and what each job entails from start to finish.</p>
